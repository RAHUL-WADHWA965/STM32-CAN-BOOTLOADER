# STM32-CAN-BOOTLOADER
STM32F103C8T6 (PCAN-USB Bootloader)

 About The Project :-
In this project, a bootloader to flash firmware onto STM32F103C8T6 board using a PCAN-USB adapter is being developed. The firmware gets upgraded via CAN protocol and integrated with STM32 development tools.

Attributes :-
Custom CAN bootloader for STM32F103C8T6
Firmware upload via PCAN-USB
STM32CubeMX integration
Example firmware included

Pre-requisites :-
STM32F103C8T6 board
PCAN-USB adapter
PC with PCAN-View or PCAN-Tools
STM32CubeMX and STM32CubeIDE

Getting Started :-
Connect Hardware: Set up the STM32F103C8T6 and PCAN-USB adapter.
Install Software: Get the PCAN-USB drivers, STM32CubeMX, and STM32CubeIDE.
Configure Bootloader: Use STM32CubeMX to set up and flash the bootloader.
Upload Firmware: Use PCAN-USB to load firmware onto the STM32F103C8T6.
Test: Check firmware functionality and bootloader performance.
